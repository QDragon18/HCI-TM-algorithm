# HCI-TM-algorithm
The HCI-TM algorithm (Hypergraph-based Threshold Model) is a threshold propagation algorithm based on the hypergraph model, designed to identify the node set with maximum influence. And the open source code includes hypergraph building module, threshold propagation module, HCI1-TM algorithm module and HCI2-TM algorithm module.
